# ShiftLeft: Securing the Software Supply Chain by Code-centric Analysis

The ShiftLeft project seeks to transform the security of Software Supply Chains (SSCs) by introducing a declarative code-centric platform supporting continuous security analysis. It incorporates foundational frameworks, novel abstractions combining static and dynamic techniques, and human-in-the-loop feedback with AI-driven prioritization metrics. The project's objectives include developing expressive security models, building a scalable security analysis platform, and creating an open-source security dashboard integrated into the software development lifecycle for real-world SSCs.

ShiftLeft is funded by the  [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org/) via the [NEST (Novelty, Excellence, Synergy, and Teams) ](https://wasp-sweden.org/calls/call-for-nests-in-cyber-security/) instrument. The project is lead by the PI, Prof. Musard Balliu (KTH Royal Institute of Technology). The co-PIs are Prof. Alexandre Bartel (Ume√• University), Prof. Christoph Reichenbach (Lund University), Prof. David Sands and Prof. Rebekka Wohlrab (Chalmers University of Technology). The industrial partners are Cparta Cyber Defense, Debricked, Ericsson, Recorded Futures, and SEB.
